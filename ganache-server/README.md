# Ganache Server with latest ganache-core

This can be used to run a ganache server locally with the latest version of ganache-core. 

It solves the problem when withdrawing ethers from a smart contract. 

However, it still does not solve the issue [1174](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/issues/1174).

To run it on localhost and port 7545 use:

```
npm start
```
